# Etch-a-sketch

This is project is to create a 2D matrix of square divs dynamically based on the user input (eg., 16x16, 20x20, etc.).

## Plan

- Create a grid container with equal width and height
- Given number of squares per row and column (n), create (n \* n) squares and place them in the container with each square's width and height is gridContainer's width / n.
- User input of grid size can be changed using the slider (input range)
- When user hovers over a grid item, it changes to a random color.
- A reset button is give to reset the colors back to white in all grid items
